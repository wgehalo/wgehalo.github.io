      <description>Cryptopals is a series of cryptology related challenges broken into sets, escalating in difficulty. I was recommended to check out this site by another user in a Nintendo Switch Hacking discord server.You can find this server here: https://discord.gg/ZdqEhed
In fact, a lot of my recent drive to learn hacking was watching the Nintendo Switch hacking scene unfold. It was extremely interesting to see the breadth, and depth of knowledge that came together.</description>
