      <description>Welcome to another Forest Hex hacking adventure! üå≤üèπ Today I will be hacking an HTB box named bitlab.
 Let&amp;rsquo;s dive right in with a port scan, and as always, feel free to jump around.

      <description>Welcome to another Forest Hex hacking adventure! üå≤üèπ
Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to exploit some poor programming decisions and leverage those into a root shell. Grab a beer and come along for the ride.
  Port Scan As always, I start with a port scan to see what&amp;rsquo;s open. I do a quick scan of all ports using nmap and then pipe those into a new, more thorough nmap scan.</description>

      <description>Welcome to another Forest Hex hacking adventure! üå≤üèπ Today&amp;rsquo;s plan is to explore a retired CTF from http://hackthebox.eu named &amp;ldquo;Beep&amp;rdquo;. I chose this box because it&amp;rsquo;s easy, it&amp;rsquo;s linux, and it&amp;rsquo;s rated very highly. All that put together should add up to some serious fun, so let&amp;rsquo;s get started:

      <title>Buffer Overflow on ARM - Part 2</title>

      <description>Hello again faithful readers! Today we are going to explore another buffer overflow on an ARM binary. The previous challenge involved overwriting a variable. This one is going to overflow the return address instead.
What&amp;rsquo;s the return address? The return address is a value stored on the stack whenever a function is called. After the function finishes, the CPU will load the value of the return address and attempt to execute the data there.</description>

      <description>Why hello there faithful reader! It&amp;rsquo;s time again for another hacking related post.
Today we&amp;rsquo;ll be continuing on from our last post where we executed a buffer overflow to overwrite a secret number to reveal a flag.
So, a quick recap:
 We have a buffer overflow for a service which accepts our input. We can send it anything we want, if we have some way to represent non-printable characters. We need to send it 129 bytes, with the first being 0x0 and the last being \n The program lives on a remote server that we can connect via an IPv4 address.</description>

      <description>Hello again faithful readers! Today&amp;rsquo;s post is about exploiting a buffer overflow.
A few days ago I was invited to attempt some binary exploitation challenges for ARM architecture. Of course I agreed, despite the fact that I have no experience debugging ARM binaries. That&amp;rsquo;s okay though, it&amp;rsquo;s how you learn.
I was happy to see the source code provided, and even happier when I was able to quickly identify the path to success without needing a debugger at all.</description>

      <description>Welcome to another Forest Hex crypto adventure! üå≤üèπ Today I will be walking through the first Cryptopals challenge.
Cryptopals is a series of cryptology related challenges broken into sets, escalating in difficulty. I was recommended to check out this site by another user in a Nintendo Switch Hacking discord server.You can find this server here: https://discord.gg/ZdqEhed
In fact, a lot of my recent drive to learn hacking was watching the Nintendo Switch hacking scene unfold.</description>

      <description>I created this page to follow my journey through the world of hacking. The term &amp;ldquo;hacking&amp;rdquo; is very broad, so to be more specific this blog will focus on hacking software.
That&amp;rsquo;s still a pretty large field, so let&amp;rsquo;s break it down a bit:
 Binary Exploitation Web App Exploitation Cryptography Cracking  My main method for learning will be participating in CTF challenges.
CTF (Capture the Flag) challenges are systems that are set up with the purpose of being exploited.</description>
