      <description>Hello again faithful readers! Today we are going to explore another buffer overflow on an ARM binary. The previous challenge involved overwriting a variable. This one is going to overflow the return address instead.
What&#39;s the return address? The return address is a value stored on the stack whenever a function is called. After the function finishes, the CPU will load the value of the return address and attempt to execute the data there.</description>

      <description>Why hello there faithful reader! It&#39;s time again for another hacking related post.
Today we&#39;ll be continuing on from our last post where we executed a buffer overflow to overwrite a secret number to reveal a flag.
So, a quick recap:
 We have a buffer overflow for a service which accepts our input. We can send it anything we want, if we have some way to represent non-printable characters. We need to send it 129 bytes, with the first being 0x0 and the last being \n The program lives on a remote server that we can connect via an IPv4 address.</description>

      <description>Hello again faithful readers! Today&#39;s post is about exploiting a buffer overflow.
A few days ago I was invited to attempt some binary exploitation challenges for ARM architecture. Of course I agreed, despite the fact that I have no experience debugging ARM binaries. That&#39;s okay though, it&#39;s how you learn.
I was happy to see the source code provided, and even happier when I was able to quickly identify the path to success without needing a debugger at all.</description>
